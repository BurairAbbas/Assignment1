    The Head First Lounge is, no doubt, the biggest trendsetter in Webville.
    Stop in to sample the eclectic offering of elixirs, teas, and coffees,
    or, stay a bit longer and enjoy the multicultural culinary menu that
    combines a harmony of taste, texture, and color with the best in fresh
    and healthy ingredients.
  </p>

  <p>
    During your stay at the lounge, you'll enjoy a smooth mixture of
    ambient and mystic sounds, filling the lounge and adding an extra dimension
    to your dining experience. The decor surrounds you with the relaxing sentiments
    of sights from eras past. And, don't forget, the lounge offers free wireless

    Our guarantee: at the lounge, we're committed to providing
    you, our guest, with an exceptional experience every time you
    visit. Whether you're just stopping by to check in on email
    over an elixir, or are here for an out-of-the-ordinary dinner,
    you'll find our knowledgeable service staff pay attention to every
    detail. If you're not fully satisfied, have a Blueberry Bliss
    Elixir on us.

  </p>
 
  <p>
    But that's not all; at night, join us in the backroom as our resident
    DJ spins a choice selection of trance and drum&amp;bass beats across
    our spacious tiki-themed dance floor. Or just hang out in one of our
    comfy white vinyl booths at the dance bar. You can have your elixirs
    delivered from the main lounge right to the dance floor. If you've
    had enough of the beat, just head back to the lounge area to relax.
    And, no matter where you find yourself in the lounge, you'll always be
    connected with our wireless Internet access.
